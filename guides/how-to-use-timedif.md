# How to use timedif

The `timedif` command is used for checking the time difference between two Discord object IDs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
All Discord IDs like user IDs, message IDs, role IDs, etc. are just timestamps, but encoded. This command decodes the IDs to get the timestamp and compares it to the other one to get the difference.
{% endhint %}
